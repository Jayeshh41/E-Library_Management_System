# E-Library_Management_System
The Online E-Library Management System is a frontend web application built using HTML and CSS in order to provide an intuitive platform to manage as well as access various digital books. It has got a neat homepage. There is a section that gives information on the books available along with their key information, including author and genre. Users can find books using a search bar. Designed with a responsive layout, the interface provides smooth navigation across all devices, thus ensuring an optimal experience for both desktop and mobile users. The project follows a clean and user-friendly design to increase usability, completely on the frontend presentation. Users can browse books, check out categories, or connect through the contact page. This was a lightweight static web project, more to be used as a base to add other backend functions or integrate with the API in future iterations. It's easy to clone the repository, open the home.html in a web browser, and browse the library system by clicking on the links found there.
